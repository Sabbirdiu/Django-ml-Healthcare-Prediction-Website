# Medic

A place where every person will be considerd as a god is the hospital and the gods are doctors. We need to have an appointment to meet them. 

This system, Medic will make that even easier to the patient as a smooth process. The webapp medic will have a smooth interface which helps patients and doctors can use this effectively.

The doctor can review the patients appointments and add the doctors availablity based on that the patients appointment will be taken.

For the patients feasablity this webapp provides the disease prediction. Just by uploading the values they are having during the tests need to be uploaded. Based on those values the disease will be predicted.

In the webapp we are providing predictions for the Diabetes, breast cancer, heart disease based on the well trained algorithms such as KNN and random forest.
